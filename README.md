# Notion recurring tasks script

## TODOs

[ ] Add comments/doc strings
[ ] Use Notion DB for keeping track of runs, not a file
[ ] Add gh action to run nightly (date might get messed up because Notion API only compares dates)
[ ] Improve copy functionality (should be able to take arbitrary database and property names, fetch the types, and know
how to copy from one to the other; e.g. we know how to copy multi-select, select, date, etc.)
[ ] Flesh out README
[ ] Post on Reddit?
